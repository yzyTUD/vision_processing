            I took a look into some literature and found that there are some existing methods 
            works well with mesh simplification. eg. 
            I tried to use xxx to simplify our APB model and got a relative good result. 
            So it is a little bit unclear to me: 
            What would be our goal? Are we going to extract faces directly from point clouds?
