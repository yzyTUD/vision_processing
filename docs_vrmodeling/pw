    abstract 
        3D scanning provides the foundation for remote exploration and co-working with 
            industrial robots. Despite the plethora of 3d reconstruction systems, 
            using 3D Scanning in a Virtual Reality environment for integrated acquisition 
            and modelling is an upcoming research area. In this thesis, an interactive modelling 
            framework in VR will be developed incorporating 3D scanning. 
            The user can work interactively on the newly acquired 3D scans to build a model 
            with high-level structural information. The implementation will be done in the 
            CGV framework that supports basic functionality for immersive 3D Scanning.
        The proposed method is best suitable for reconstruct scenes generated by humans such as rooms 
            with furniture as well as individual objects like a monitor, a bottle, a telephone, etc. and is especially 
            useful for antiques or mechanical components where accurate reconstructions are expected.   
    
    1.INTRODUCTION
        the main contributions of this work are the following ones:
            1. Interactive modeling scheme
                The most interesting part of this work is that one can generate models interactively 
                    with the help of point clouds.
                Instead of sophisticated algorithms, users can control the modeling process intuitively.
            2. High quality meshes
                with this work, one can generate high-quality meshes with a relatively low cost when compared to 
                    fusion-based methods and laser-based methods
            3. Provide compact and flexible structural information as output
                frames, point clouds, extracted faces and many other information can be recorded.
                Also, high-level structural information can be expected as part of the output. 
            compact model representation, compressed model transfer
            Cultural relic protection
            easy to triangulation afterwards (after region growing)
            ...
        It has a potential to handle arbitrary complex objectsâ€‹.
        With this work, an novel modeling pipeline has been demostrated, 
        Other surface or volume based reconstruction algorithms can be ported to VR in a similar way.

                in this process, we end up with a mesh, where each vertex, edge and face has a set of points 
                    assigned to it.
            surface fitting 
                In this step, we fit positions to the points of a vertex, curves to the points of an edge and 
                    surfaces to the points of a face.
